export const HERO_CONTENT = `I'm a beginner full-stack web developer with a strong interest in building interactive and user-friendly web applications. I recently developed a DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) quiz app as my first project, where I handled everything from frontend design to backend functionality using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB. I’ve also built a chatbot AI project, which helped me understand real-time user interactions and dynamic content generation. I'm currently focused on improving my skills, exploring new frameworks, and building more real-world projects. I'm excited to grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful software solutions.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am a passionate and curious full-stack web development learner with a strong interest in building modern, user-friendly web applications. I’ve been exploring technologies like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and front-end tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As part of my learning journey, I’ve built projects like a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) quiz app, which helped me understand both functionality and design. My interest in development started with a curiosity for how websites and applications work, and I’m continuously working on improving my skills through hands-on practice and small projects. I enjoy learning new technologies, solving programming challenges, and gradually building the confidence to contribute to real-world development.`;
